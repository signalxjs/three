# repo-template — how we work in SignalX

> The canonical engineering setup for every repo under
> [`signalxjs`](https://github.com/signalxjs). This is a **GitHub template
> repository**: click **“Use this template”** to start a new repo with the
> agent workflow, git-worktree flow, CI/release pipeline, branch protection,
> and governance docs already wired up. Existing repos adopt it by copying the
> files in (see [`docs/adopting.md`](docs/adopting.md)).

It captures the patterns first proven in
[`signalxjs/core`](https://github.com/signalxjs/core) and makes them portable.

## TL;DR — the rules that matter

1. **Branch first. Never work on `main`.** Every change — however small — happens
   in a git worktree at `<repo>/branches/<name>`, never in the primary checkout
   at `<repo>/main`. See [the worktree flow](#git-worktrees--the-mainbranches-layout).
2. **Issue → worktree → PR → review → squash-merge.** This is the whole loop.
   Agents make it mandatory (even for one-liners); humans may skip the issue.
   See [the development workflow](#the-development-workflow).
3. **`main` is protected.** No direct pushes, PR + green CI + review required,
   squash-only. Enforced as code by
   [`scripts/apply-branch-protection.mjs`](scripts/apply-branch-protection.mjs).
4. **Agents read `AGENTS.md`.** It is the single, tool-neutral source of truth.
   `CLAUDE.md` (and any future tool file) is a thin shim that `@`-imports it.
5. **Verify before “done.”** Typecheck + test + build, with evidence, before any
   PR is merged. CI re-checks the same commands on Linux + Windows.

## What’s in this template

| Path | What it is | Portable as-is? |
|---|---|---|
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Tool-neutral agent guide: the workflow, build/test, conventions | Edit the repo-specific top + “Build/Test” + “Packages” sections |
| [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) | Thin Claude Code shim that imports `AGENTS.md` | **Verbatim** |
| [`scripts/worktree.mjs`](scripts/worktree.mjs) | `pnpm wt new/list/rm` — the worktree helper | **Verbatim** |
| [`scripts/apply-branch-protection.mjs`](scripts/apply-branch-protection.mjs) | Applies the `main` ruleset via `gh api` | **Verbatim** (pass the repo) |
| [`scripts/sync-core.mjs`](scripts/sync-core.mjs) | `pnpm sync:core` — aligns the `catalog:` core pins (and the explanatory comment above them) to a core version (`--check` drift guard) | **Verbatim** |
| [`scripts/check-catalog.mjs`](scripts/check-catalog.mjs) | `pnpm verify:catalog` — guards the single-minor catalog invariant (CI + local) | **Verbatim** |
| [`scripts/lib/core-deps.mjs`](scripts/lib/core-deps.mjs) | The core-package list + inline-pin scan the two scripts above share | **Verbatim** — copy it or neither runs |
| [`.github/workflows/`](.github/workflows) | CI, bundle-size, release, release-drafter, dependabot auto-merge, core-sync | Mostly verbatim; trim per repo |
| [`.github/`](.github) | CODEOWNERS, dependabot, PR + issue templates, SUPPORT | Edit owners, package lists |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` | Governance | Edit repo name/scope |
| [`.npmrc`](.npmrc), [`.gitignore`](.gitignore), [`.size-limit.json`](.size-limit.json) | Workspace config | Edit paths/scope |
| [`docs/`](docs) | The long-form handbook (workflow, branch rules, adopting) | Reference |

Anything marked **verbatim** should be copied unchanged so it stays identical
across repos — that’s what makes the muscle memory transfer between projects.
Placeholders that must change per repo are written as `<REPO>` (the repo name)
or flagged with a `TODO(sigx-standard)` comment.

## The development workflow

`issue → worktree → PR → Copilot review → squash-merge`. This is mandatory for
**every agent-driven change**, including one-line fixes. Human contributors may
skip the issue (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`); the worktree + PR + review are not
optional for anyone.

1. **Issue first.** No tracking issue yet? Create one *before* writing code, and
   put the plan in the body. If you worked in plan mode, the approved plan **is**
   the issue body.
   ```sh
   gh issue create --title "<concise title>" --body "<what & why + the plan>"
   ```
2. **Worktree, always.** `pnpm wt new <N-short-slug>` (where `N` is the issue
   number) gives an isolated checkout on branch `<N-short-slug>` with deps
   installed. Never `git switch -c` in `<repo>/main` — parallel sessions share it.
3. **Implement & verify.** Make the change, then prove it: `pnpm typecheck`
   (always, for any `.ts`) plus the relevant `pnpm test` / `pnpm build`. Stage
   specific files (`git add <path>`), never `git add -A`. No co-author trailers.
4. **Open a PR with Copilot as reviewer.** Reference the issue so it auto-closes:
   ```sh
   gh pr create --base main --title "<title>" \
     --body "Closes #N. <short summary>" --reviewer @copilot
   ```
5. **Wait for the review, then fix.** Don’t merge before Copilot has reviewed.
   Address every actionable comment with follow-up commits; re-request review
   until there’s no remaining feedback.
6. **Merge it yourself** once review is resolved **and** CI is green:
   ```sh
   gh pr checks <pr>                          # all green first
   gh pr merge <pr> --squash --delete-branch
   pnpm wt rm <name>                          # clean up the worktree
   ```

The full version, including the `gh api` fallback when `@copilot` won’t resolve,
lives in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) and [`docs/how-we-work.md`](docs/how-we-work.md).

## Git worktrees — the `main`/`branches` layout

Every sigx repo is checked out as:

```
<repo>/
  main/                 # the primary checkout — read/build here, never edit
  branches/
    <name>/             # one worktree per branch, deps installed
    <other>/
```

`scripts/worktree.mjs` (exposed as `pnpm wt`) is the only tool you need:

```sh
pnpm wt new <name> [--from <branch>]   # new worktree at <repo>/branches/<name>
pnpm wt list                           # show all worktrees ((main) is flagged)
pnpm wt rm <name> [--force]            # remove one (won't touch main or your cwd)
```

Each worktree is an independent checkout, so you can launch a **separate agent
session per directory** and work several things in parallel without ever
switching branches in place. The script enforces the `main` layout, refuses to
delete the checkout you’re standing in, and cleans up pnpm’s Windows
node_modules junctions that `git worktree remove` chokes on.

---

## Branch protection (`main` is protected)

Branch rules live in GitHub settings, not files — so we keep them **as code**.
Run once per repo (needs `gh auth login` with admin on the repo):

```sh
node scripts/apply-branch-protection.mjs signalxjs/<REPO>
```

It applies a repository **ruleset** that requires, on `main`:

- **No direct pushes** — all changes land via PR.
- **A pull request** with at least one approving review, stale approvals
  dismissed on new commits, and CODEOWNERS review where applicable.
- **Required status checks green** — the CI jobs (lint, typecheck, build, test)
  must pass before merge.
- **Squash-only merges** — linear history; merge commits are blocked.
- **No force-push, no deletion** of `main`.

See [`docs/branch-protection.md`](docs/branch-protection.md) for the exact
ruleset and the reasoning.

## CI / release pipeline

| Workflow | Trigger | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | PR + push to `main` | Lint → **verify:catalog** → typecheck → build → test on Node 20/22 (Linux) + 22 (Windows); pack-verify; coverage → Codecov |
| `core-sync.yml` | `core-released` dispatch, weekly cron, manual | Aligns the `catalog:` core pins (and each publishable package's peer shape) to the new core version, proves it builds/tests green, then opens/updates a **“chore: align with core”** PR |
| `codecov.yml` | (config) | **Patch-coverage gate** — `codecov/patch` fails a PR whose changed lines aren't tested, enforcing the test-first convention. Project coverage stays informational |
| `bundle-size.yml` | PR | `size-limit` check, comments the delta on the PR |
| `release-drafter.yml` | push/PR to `main` | Maintains a draft release + auto-labels PRs from Conventional-Commit titles |
| `release.yml` | tag `v*.*.*` | Re-runs the full gate, then npm **trusted publishing** (OIDC, provenance) + GitHub Release |
| `dependabot-automerge.yml` | Dependabot PRs | Auto-merges green patch-level dependency bumps |

Releasing is tag-driven: bump versions → push a `vX.Y.Z` tag → `release.yml`
publishes. No tokens in CI for npm — it uses OIDC trusted publishing, configured
per-package on npmjs.com.

## Staying aligned with sigx core

Every sigx repo consumes core packages (`@sigx/reactivity`, `@sigx/runtime-core`,
`@sigx/runtime-dom`, `@sigx/server-renderer`, `@sigx/server`, `@sigx/ssr-islands`,
`@sigx/resume`, `@sigx/cache`, `@sigx/vite`, `sigx`). Because core keeps reactive
state in module-local variables, **exactly one physical copy must resolve** — two
copies silently break reactivity. The guarantee: pin every core package to a
**single minor** (`^X.Y.0` == `>=X.Y.0 <X.(Y+1).0`) so pnpm hoists one copy, and
declare that pin **once** — in the `catalog:` block of `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Every
package.json then references it as `"catalog:"`.

Three pieces keep that invariant honest and make a core bump a one-line, automated
PR:

| Piece | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`scripts/check-catalog.mjs`](scripts/check-catalog.mjs) (`pnpm verify:catalog`) | Fails CI if any package.json declares a core dep with an **inline** version instead of `"catalog:"`, if a catalog core entry isn't a single-minor `^X.Y.0` (or the exact `^X.0.0-<pre>` caret — `^1.0.0-rc.0` — while aligned to a new major's prerelease), or if a **publishable** package departs from core 1.0's shape — a core singleton in its `dependencies`, a peer at a range other than the one the catalog pin derives, or a peer without its `devDependencies: "catalog:"` twin. Wired into `ci.yml`. |
| [`scripts/sync-core.mjs`](scripts/sync-core.mjs) (`pnpm sync:core [version]`) | Rewrites the catalog's **core** entries to `^X.Y.0` (siblings like `@sigx/router` are left alone), **and** refreshes the explanatory comment directly above the `catalog:` block so its `^X.Y.0` / `>=X.Y.0 <X.(Y+1).0` prose never goes stale on a bump (a stale comment used to force otherwise-clean bumps AMBER when Copilot flagged it). The comment rewrite is keyed on the version the catalog currently pins, so an unrelated caret in that block (a Node engines note, say) is never touched. No arg = latest on npm; `1.0.0-rc.0` pins the exact prerelease caret (the only range that resolves an rc). It also writes **the 1.0 peer shape** into every publishable package (`private` manifests are never touched): a core singleton in `dependencies` moves to `peerDependencies` at the range the catalog pin derives — `^X.0.0` on 1.x+, the catalog's own `^0.Y.0` on 0.x — with a `devDependencies: "catalog:"` twin, and an existing peer is re-pinned on a major bump; the leaf and build-time packages (`@sigx/serialize`, `@sigx/vite`, the deploy adapters) stay `"catalog:"` where they are. `--check` exits non-zero if a change *would* be made — pins, comment or manifests (drift guard). Refuses to run — non-zero, naming each specifier — in a repo whose core deps carry an inline version where `"catalog:"` is required, since it will not guess which catalog entry a hand-written range meant and would otherwise report a false "already aligned". |
| [`scripts/lib/core-deps.mjs`](scripts/lib/core-deps.mjs) | The single `CORE_PACKAGES` list, the singleton/exempt split, the peer-range rule and the shared manifest scan + rewrite. **Keep it in sync with `corePackages` in core's [`docs/ecosystem.json`](https://github.com/signalxjs/core/blob/main/docs/ecosystem.json)** — core's CI fails when a newly published package is missing there, and that failure is the cue to update this list too. A core package absent from here gets neither the rewrite nor the guard, silently. |
| [`.github/workflows/core-sync.yml`](.github/workflows/core-sync.yml) | Runs `sync:core`, then `install → build → typecheck → test → verify:catalog`, and only if all green opens/updates a **“chore: align with core”** PR. A red PR never appears: if a core release breaks this repo, the workflow fails loudly instead. |

### Closing the loop (core → consumers)

`core-sync.yml` triggers three ways:

- **`repository_dispatch` (`core-released`)** — the fast path. `signalxjs/core`’s
  `release.yml` fans out a `core-released` event to every consumer right after it
  publishes, so alignment PRs appear within minutes of a core release.
- **`schedule`** — a weekly Monday cron as a safety net for any dispatch that was
  missed (token expired, workflow absent, …).
- **`workflow_dispatch`** — manual, with an optional target version.

**The dispatch side lives in core, and needs a token.** The default `GITHUB_TOKEN`
cannot dispatch to *other* repos, so core’s `notify-consumers` job authenticates
with an **`ECOSYSTEM_DISPATCH_TOKEN`** secret — a fine-grained PAT whose
**resource owner is the org** (not a personal account) granting **`Contents: Read
and write`** on each consumer repo. There is no "Repository dispatch" permission —
`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/dispatches` requires `Contents: Read and write`, which
is broader than the job needs and the narrowest GitHub offers for it. See the companion
change in [`signalxjs/core`](https://github.com/signalxjs/core) that adds that job
to `release.yml`. Until that token is created and that job merged, `core-sync.yml`
still works via the weekly cron and manual dispatch — the dispatch just makes it
instant.

## Adopting this in a repo

- **New repo:** click **“Use this template”** on GitHub, then follow the
  customization checklist in [`docs/adopting.md`](docs/adopting.md).
- **Existing repo:** copy the files in per [`docs/adopting.md`](docs/adopting.md).

After either, run `node scripts/apply-branch-protection.mjs signalxjs/<REPO>`
once to lock down `main`.

---

## Suggestions / roadmap

A few improvements worth considering (and tracked as issues here):

- **An `init` script** that copies the standard into an existing repo and patches
  its `package.json` in one command (degit-style). Deferred for now — the
  template + checklist covers the common case.
- **An org-level `signalxjs/.github` repo** for community-health *defaults*
  (CONTRIBUTING/SECURITY/issue-templates) so repos that don’t override them
  inherit automatically. Complements this template rather than replacing it.
- **A `renovate`/dependabot grouping convention** shared across repos.
- **Reusable workflows** (`workflow_call`) so `ci.yml` is one line per repo
  instead of a copied file — reduces drift but adds a moving part.

See [`docs/how-we-work.md`](docs/how-we-work.md) for the rationale behind each
convention.
